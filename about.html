            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Founded in 2022, The Vault began as a small blog dedicated to preserving and sharing the magic of physical media. In an era dominated by streaming, our founders, Emmanuel and Ayah, who met each other on the online film cataloging site Letterboxd, saw the potential in collecting and distributing rare and classic home videos. In the past year, the company has achieved huge success while also facing challenges. Yet, our mission has remained the same: to bring the joy of home entertainment to viewers around the world.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>In a world where streaming services dominate, we believe in the enduring value of physical media. There's something special about holding a movie in your hands, admiring its cover art, and owning a piece of cinematic history. At The Vault, we're passionate about curating a diverse collection of films that spans genres, decades, and cultures. Our goal is to ensure that these treasures are accessible to all who appreciate the art of film.</p>
